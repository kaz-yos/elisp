;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20510333/in-emacs-how-to-show-current-file-in-finder
;; Thank you elemakil and lawlist for introducing this nice piece of code,
;; and Peter Salazar for pointing out a useful link about AppleScript (below).
;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11222501/finding-a-file-selecting-it-in-finder-issue
;; 
;; What this does:
;;
;; If M-x reveal-in-finder is invoked in a file-associated buffer,
;; it will open the folder enclosing the file in the OS X Finder.
;; It will also select the file the buffer is associated with within the folder.
;;
;; If M-x reveal-in-finder is invoked in a buffer not associated with a file,
;; it will open the folder defined in the default-directory variable.
;; In a dired buffer, this should open the current folder in the OS X Finder.


;;; Dependencies
;;
;; None. It only works on the Mac platform with AppleScript support.


;;; Usage
;;
;; From a file-associated buffer, just M-x reveal-in-finder RET.
;; It will take you to the enclosing folder in the OS X Finder, highlighting the file.
;; 
;; From a dired buffer, also just M-x reveal-in-finder RET.
;; It will take you to the folder, highlighting the folder itself.


;;; Code:

;; Function to obtain the path to the file and/or the folder.
;;;###autoload
(defun reveal-in-finder ()

      ;; If path is empty, there is no file name. Use the default-directory variable.
      ;; This should work in a dired buffer.
